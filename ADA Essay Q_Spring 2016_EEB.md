1. **Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? **

 LightBot was my first exposure to something that purported to directly teach programming problem-solving skills. I was rapidly obsessed with getting the robot to go on the path I wanted it to, to light up the correct boxes and to do it in the fewest steps possible. When I found a solution, the satisfaction felt incredible. That little robot led me to realize how much I crave that specific kind of mental aerobics.  I'm interested in programming because it blends creativity and logical, analytical thinking in a way that fits my natural tendencies toward problem solving.  The versatility in the ability to work collaboratively to create useful tools that positively impact people’s lives in a variety of contexts is also appealing. 

To expose myself to underlying concepts, I took Introductory Computer Science courses through Coursera and Khan Academy.  I've been learning Ruby through Codeacademy and *Ruby Wizardry *by Eric Weinstien.  Devouring brains and entrails is my latest foray into programming with "Rails for Zombies". Programmers in my network, as well as ladies at Girl Develop It MeetUps, have graciously hosted me for informal interviews to learn more about their careers. I’m hooked and excited to learn more!

 

2. **What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?**

** **

	In the next 2 years, after successfully completing ADA, I'd like to be employed as a full-time developer in a socially-conscious company that will allow me to continue to grow both front-end and back-end skills. Along the way, I’d like to continue to volunteer with organizations that support girls in STEM, such as IGNITE worldwide, or teach computer science classes for girls in schools or informal education institutions. Within those first years, I would also like to grow my network and understanding of the technology field more broadly and find a compatible mentor to support my growth. In 5 years, I would like to be a developer for an organization that creates effective, useful educational technology tools. I have a strong background in creating educational games, curriculum and engaging learning tools, and see myself applying that background to developing digital media. I am open to the process and refining interests along the way, but feel confident that EdTech is a compelling nexus of my interests and passions, and I have much to contribute to the field.  

3. **Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? **

**	**  

My name is Erin Bond and my partner's name is Stuart Ryan. While I’m usually not a hearts-and-giggles girl, when we got engaged, it was euphoric time that consumed most of my emotional and mental space.  The day after the engagement, we bought flights. I booked my ticket for "Erin Ryan". Yep, I entered my own name wrong. Not surprisingly, airlines don’t let you on the plane if the name on your ticket doesn’t match your identification.  

What did I learn? Sometimes the little things - the seemingly most trivial things- create a cascade of issues if you flub them.  I learned to check and double check. (I've found this to be especially applicable in programming!) If I encountered a similar situation- besides, obviously, spelling my name correctly- I would laugh at myself sooner. There is humanity and humility in mistakes. Even though it was infuriating and expensive to re-book a flight and I felt guilty about inconveniencing my partner, I wish I would have found perspective more easily  in the moment and realized there wasn’t any irreparable damage. I would tell my husband that I value his calm flexibility. I would be kinder with myself and forgive myself more easily.

	

4. **Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it. **

Despite minimal experience with mechanics, I recently decided to change a tire and the oil and undertake basic maintenance tasks on my Honda Metropolitan scooter. First, I Googled for how-to guides and found they referenced parts with which I was only vaguely familiar. So, I spent time perusing the owner's manual, particularly the diagrams, learning the names of parts and how they fit together. Next, I hopped back online to watch YouTube videos of scooter repair demonstrations. Then, I went to the local automotive parts shop for supplies and a chat with the clerk who shared tips for my novice endeavor. Back in my driveway, I photo documented steps of disassembly so I would know what it should look like when I did the process in reverse to reassemble the scooter.  The project involved frequently pausing my reference videos to reorient myself, trial and error, quizzical looks from my neighbors, a dash of frustration, and backtracking, but ultimately I completed my tasks. In addition to learning basic scooter maintenance, I was reminded that, with a little grit and a savvy collection of various resources, I can tinker my way through any pursuit.
